00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.629
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:05.710
that robs the ability to

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.270
remember, think, and reason, affecting the

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.350
very essence of a person, their

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.990
memories and identity. At first,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.230
the symptoms are subtle. The person

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.150
may forget where they left their keys or

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.390
recent appointments, but then they become

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.950
more severe: difficulty planning,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.070
loss of sense of time and place,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.269
or inability to hold a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.790
conversation. This happens because the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.550
disease gradually damages the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.549
neurons, and the brain begins to

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.190
shrink, affecting vital areas.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.190
First the hippocampus, our memory center,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.510
and then the areas of logic and

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.150
language. The person may become

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.190
confused, anxious, or experience

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.029
drastic mood changes. Although there is no

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.869
definitive cure yet, treatments

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.430
aim to slow the progression

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.430
of the disease and manage

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.869
symptoms. Activities like cognitive stimulation,

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.830
including memory games or puzzles,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.470
help keep the brain active. Additionally,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.150
listening to music and looking at photos

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.149
helps awaken memories and emotions.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.550
